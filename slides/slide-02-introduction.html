             <li>Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text and code.</li>
             <li>In software development, they act as intelligent assistants.</li>
             <li>They go beyond simple autocompletion to understand context, generate code, explain concepts, and even perform actions.</li>
             <li>Think of them as a "pair programmer" that's available 24/7.</li>
